    The goal of this work is to develop a system that identifies and filters spoiler contents for arbitrary topics chosen by the user. To achieve this, it is necessary to use machine learning and deep learning techniques to thoroughly understand the topic of interest and generate a model capable of recognizing any type of content related to it, whether it is textual or visual. To do this, it is necessary to scrape images and text from various online sources such as websites, social media, forums, blogs, etc. and create an appropriate dataset for training the model. The final system should be able to automatically detect and hide spoiler contents for the topic chosen by the user, ensuring a better media consumption experience.
